## Dependencies

These scripts need python 2.7+ and the following libraries to work:

1. pillow(~2.8.1)
2. numpy(~1.9.0)
3. python-opencv(~2.4.11)

The simplest way to install all of them is to install [python(x,y)](https://code.google.com/p/pythonxy/wiki/Downloads?tm=2).

If you can't install python(x,y), You can install python, numpy and python-opencv seperately, then install pip and pillow.

1. Install python. Just use the installer from [python's website](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Install numpy. Just use the installer from [scipy's website](http://www.scipy.org/scipylib/download.html). (You don't need scipy to run this project, so you can just install numpy alone).
3. Install python-opencv. Download the release from [its sourceforge site](http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/files/). (Choose the release based on your operating system, then choose version 2.4.11). The executable is just an archive. Extract the files, then copy `cv2.pyd` to the `lib/site-packages` folder on your python installation path.
4. Install pip. Download [the script for installing pip](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py), open cmd (or termianl if you are using Linux/Mac OS X), go to the path where the downloaded script resides, and run `python get-pip.py`
5. Install pillow. Run `pip install pillow`. 

If you are running the code under Linux/Mac OS X and the scripts throw `AttributeError: __float__`, make sure your pillow has jpeg support (consult [Pillow's document](http://pillow.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html)) e.g. try:

```
sudo apt-get install libjpeg-dev
sudo pip uninstall pillow
sudo pip install pillow
```

If you have any problem installing the dependencies, contact the author.

## How to generate the results

1. To generate all results, enter the `src` directory, run

  ```
  python main.py
  ```

  It will use images under `dataset` directory to produce the results. The results will show up in `result` directory. Intermediate results will be saved too.

2. To see how long the script will need to generate the results (without saving them or the intermediate images), run

  ```
  python main.py -t
  ```

3. To generate resized final results (by 1/3), run

  ```
  python main.py -r
  ```

4. To generate intermediate results, run

  ```
  python main.py -i
  ```

  Or if you want resized intermidate results:

  ```
  python main.py -i -r
  ```

##Directory structure
