The advancement of the Internet has resulted in many new opportunities for the creation and delivery of content in digital form. Applications include electronic advertising, real-time video and audio delivery, digital repositories and libraries, and Web publishing. But the important question that arises in these applications is the data security. It has been observed that current copyright laws are not sufficient for dealing with digital data. Hence the protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights for digital media has become a crucial issue. This has led to an interest towards developing new copy deterrence and protection mechanisms. One such effort that has been attracting increasing interest is based on digital watermarking techniques. As steganography pay most attention towards the degree of invisibility, watermarking pay most of its attributes to the robustness of the message and its ability to withstand attacks of removal, such as image operations (rotation, cropping, filtering) etc in case of images being watermarked. Digital watermarking is the process of embedding information into digital multimedia content such that the information (which we call the watermark) can later be extracted or detected for a variety of purposes including copy prevention and control. Digital watermarking has become an active and important area of research, and development and commercialization of watermarking techniques is being deemed essential to help address some of the challenges faced by the rapid proliferation of digital content.
